# Media Framing of the Tigray Conflict: A Comparative Analysis of Domestic and Western News Coverage

## Project Aim

This project investigates how the Tigray conflict (2020–2022) was framed by domestic Ethiopian media and major Western outlets.  
We focus on two Ethiopian state-affiliated newspapers—**Addis Zemen** and **The Ethiopian Herald**—and two leading Western news organizations—**The New York Times** and **The Washington Post**.

Through comparative content analysis, we aim to highlight differences and similarities in conflict reporting, narrative construction, and source framing between domestic and international media.
